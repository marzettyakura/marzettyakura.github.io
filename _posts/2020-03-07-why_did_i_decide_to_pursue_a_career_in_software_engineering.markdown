*Back in the middle of 2019 I was scrolling through my instagram page, and saw and advertisement from Career Karma. I clicked on it, and looked into it. At first I thought it was a little too good to be true, to go to school, learn how to code, and not pay anything for it, until after you get a job in coding. Mind you, I've always been drawn to anything that had to do with technology. Growing up, I usually had the latest gadgets, and things of that sort. So I downloaded the Career Karma app, met a bunch of great people that helped groom this love for coding in me. I took a bunch of pre courses that was available to me within the app, and coding was actually fun to me. I've always gravitated towards technology, and coding was just the perfect fit for me. It's been pretty rough so far, starting off, but it'll all be worth it in the long run!
